Mt. Kilimambogo is located in [Ol-Donyo Sabuk National Park][ol-donyo-sabuk], about 75 kilometres
north of Nairobi off the Thika-Garissa highway.

The trail is 9km from the park's gate to the summit, following the dirt road and 6km using the
footpaths on the lower sections of the trail. The footpaths on the lower sections were quite
enjoyable during the ascent and will get you sweating and panting. The upper section is dirt road 
only and it's not as demanding. The summit is 2145m above sea level and the elevation gain is about
720m.

The trail is scenic, starting off with thick shrubland the gives way to grassy sections with great
view points to the lands below the mountain. The grassland gives way to denser forest and eventually
to mixed montane vegetation in the upper cooler section that is closer to the summit.

We hiked with [a hiking company][outdoorer] and simplified our planning but also made for a very
busy trail during the ascent, over 100 hikers. We however had the trail to ourselves during the
descent. The trail is not difficult and made for a great start-of-year hike. It's also great for
beginners and kids.


### Practical Tips
* [Outdoorer Hiking Company][outdoorer]
* [Google Maps Location][maps-loc]
* Carry you own water, 2 litres will suffice.
* Plan to hike in the morning, the lower sections get warmer during the day.
