Elephant hill trail is located in the [Aberdare National Park][aberdare], about 80 kilometres from
Nairobi, with the start of the trail at the Njabini forest station.


The trail is about 9.5km from the forest station entrance to the summit, snaking it's way through
exotic forests, steep bamboo forests, indigenous montane forests, and Afroalpine grassland and
shrubland towards the summit. The summit is ~3650m (12000ft) above sea level and the elevation gain
is about 1321m.

_At the summit_

The trail is very scenic, starting off with dense exotic forest that gives way to denser bamboo
forest, then to indigenous forest, bamboo forests again and montane grassland and shrubland on the
upper section that's closer to the summit.

_Bamboo forest_

The trail gets steeps quickly and gets harder especially in the bamboo forests and ends up rocky
and jagged towards the summit. It's no walk in the park.

We hiked with [a hiking company][outdoorer] and simplified our planning but also made for a very
busy trail with nearly 100 hikers. It's a difficult trail and requires a bit of preparation before
hiking it. However it has several view points on the upper sections where you can end your hike
without having to summit.


### Practical Tips
* [Outdoorer Hiking Company][outdoorer]
* [Google Maps Location][maps-loc]
* Carry your own water, 3 litres will suffice.
* Have snacks or energy bars to replenish spent energy.
* Hike with trekking poles, it makes it way easier.
* Be prepared for light to heavy rain showers in the afternoon.
