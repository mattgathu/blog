Mt Ololokwe is located in Samburu county, about 140 kilometres from Nanyuki on the Isiolo -
Marsabit road.

The trail is about 5.6km from the [Sabache Camp][sabache], starting of with a steep rocky climb,
snaking its way through shrubland and leveling off to grassland on the upper sections of the mount.
The elevation gain is 787m and it took about 4 hours at moderate pace to reach our camping site.

The trail offers a lot of view points to the surrounding mountain ranges and the valley on which
Sabache camp is situated.

The trail gets steeps quickly and gets harder especially in the lower rocky sections but gets
gentle and flat at the summit. It's no walk in the park.

We hiked with a guide from the Sabache camp and he taught us a lot about the mountain, Samburu
culture and their way of life. He made the experience really magical.

### Practical Tips
* [Sabache Camp][sabache]
* [Google Maps Location][maps-loc]
* Carry your own water, 5 litres will suffice.
* Carry your own food and camping gear if you intend to camp at the summit.
* Have snacks or energy bars to replenish spent energy.
* Hike with trekking poles, it makes it way easier.
