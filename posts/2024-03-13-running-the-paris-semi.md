I got backing to running this year after running the Lewa half marathon and Nairobi half marathon last year. I had gained a few kilos since then and was motivated to lose a few.
I had previously ran the Paris 10K run and signing up for the half marathon came easy.

Most of the course was flat and gentle, mostly hugging the Seine and then traversing the Bois de Vincennes. I, however, did not find it scenic. The barricaded streets and the nondescript sections through the Vincennes woods made it all too dull and unmemorable.

The weather did not lighten up either, overcast clouds and a chilly morning temperatures did little to lift my mood. 

Au contraire, the crowds of spectators were a thing of beauty.  They cheered the runners along and my spirit was lifted many times by strangers calling out my name. 
I'm also grateful for the course staff stretching their hands to offer me water and a snack to keep me going. Merci Paris.
