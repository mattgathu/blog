A list of notes from [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking%2C_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman.

## Introduction

Kahneman aims to improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgement and choice, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them.

> JudgementÂ means the evaluation of evidence to make a decision. Judgement is also the ability to make considered decisions. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement)

Judgement goes hand in hand with [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) -  the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or course of action among several possible alternatives.


He  early work questioned the (formerly) broadly accepted ideas of social science:
- Humans are generally rational and their thinking sound.
- Emotions, such as pain and fear, explain most of the irrationality in humans.

His **Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases** article showed how people use simple heuristics in assessing probabilities and making predictions of judgements; and how these heuristics sometimes lead to systematic errors (biases).

The article discusses three heuristics:
- Representativeness
- Availability
- Adjustment and Anchoring

### Representativeness
