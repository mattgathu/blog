## The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

![naval-almanack-cover][naval-almanack-cover]

Gems, gems and more gems on life.

A collection of thoughts by a deep thinker. I learnt a lot about my own ignorance going through
this book. I made a [collection of maxims][notes-on-naval-almanack] I picked up from Naval, I would boil it down to finding
yourself, knowing yourself, being yourself and excelling at it.

## Zikora

![zikora-cover][zikora-cover]

A short story with such intensity and depth!

A poignant tale of a moment in time of a progressive African lady and the snippets of her life that
gave the moment its meaning. It reminded how birth is such a bittersweet moment, how down to earth
and bare (animalistic) it is and yet such a powerful moment as it defines destinies.

It is so moving that's it's at this moment Zikora goes through the people in her life. The women -
mother, step mother, cousin and her younger self; and the men - her father and her now absent baby daddy.
She brings up social issues of culture and tradition, friendship and committments, and work and
career ambitions.

Such an amazing story.

## The Great Mental Models Volume 1

![gmmv1-cover][gmmv1-cover]

A succint collection of great ways to go about thinking and reasoning. Grounded in science and
philosophy and leaning on real life examples, it really does provide a toolbox for actively living
life, wether be it career and business decisions or relationships and life decisions.

It reaffirmed some mental models I already new and also lead me to discover new models and new ways
of interpretations. I made [notes][notes-on-gmmv1] of nuggets I picked up.
