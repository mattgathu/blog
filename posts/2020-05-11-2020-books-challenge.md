I have been participating in the GoodRead's reading challenge this year, and I've read 10 titles so far.
This is my attempt at summarizing my reading.

1. [Dune - Frank Herbert](#dune)
2. [1984 - George Orwell](#1984)


## Dune

![dune-cover][dune-cover]

This is undoubtedly the best science fiction that I have read. A lot of it had to do with how I read it - I got the book on Kindle and also the audio book on Audible and I listened and read at the same time. The audio book is well narrated and it brought a sense of vividness and liveliness to the experience.

Dune is set on a desert planet, Arrakis and follows the journey a young heir-to-a-duke, Paul Atreides, as he discovers
his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach, the one able to bridge space and time, and as Lisan Al-Gaib, the messiah in the legends of the Fremen people of Arrakis.

The author of the book employs the use of diverse language giving the book both an exotic and familiar feel. For example, the Fremen are desert dwellers and their language borrows heavily from Arabic, almost drawing a parallel to the deserts of North Africa and Middle East.

The book blends political, economical and religious ideologies, expressing how each exert influences in defining the reality of the space age empire. The emperor exerts his political power by owning the Sardaukars, fierce legions of fighters. The Spacing Guild handles all space transport and exerts an economical monopoly - everyone has to pay them to travel. The B.Gs have their power by controlling the genetics of the ruling families, shaping their future.
This forces somehow seem to all work together,that's until Paul comes along and unravels everything.

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my  fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”


## 1984

![1984-cover][1984-cover]

A profound read that I can summarize with this quote:

> “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts completely." ~ Lord Acton

This quote isn't from the book but it captures its essence; a totalitarian regime that has upended its world for the
sole purpose of staying in power indefinitely. The Party, an new age successor to socialism and communism rules Oceania
 through suppression of all human instincts and freedom except for those that further its cause.

There is no freedom of expression or speech. Newspeak is designed for the restriction of thought and expression. 
There are thought crimes. Sexual intimacy is punishable. 
Constant surveillance is the norm, the telescreens and microphones are everywhere. All your movements are monitored.

There is a fanaticism to towards Big Brother, the embodiment of the The Party. 
Everyone loves big brother. Truth is constantly being rewritten. The truth is what the party deems it to be.

The book starts and ends in despair. Winston the protagonist ,aware of his entrapment, 
seeks to free himself of it and finds some hope in his forbidden love to Julia but 
ultimately the The Party captures them and breaks them down until all that is left is 
love for Big Brother. _There is no hope in the book._
