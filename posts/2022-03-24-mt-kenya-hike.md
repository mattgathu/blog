Mount Kenya has been on my bucket list for the last 3-4 years and finally I got to hike it! Being
Africa's second highest mountain after Kilimanjaro, it's a great way to start high altitude hiking.

Day 0: Camping at the Chogoria Gate.
--

For hikers using the Chogoria route, the Chogoria gate is usually their base camp.
The are bandas (self contained rooms) that you can stay in, we opted to pitch our tents in the open
and enjoy the nature. The Chogoria gate is quite high at 2950 metres above sea level.

A gentle introduction to Mount Kenya, most of the trail from the Chogoria gate to Lake Ellis
follows a paved murram road over gentle hills up to the road head point. On the way we passed the
special camp site, nested among tall trees.

At the road head, we took a detour and went exploring the nearby Nithi falls and caves. The falls
are very beautiful and definitely worth seeing.

We then proceeded with our gentle hiking re-uniting with the murram road and ending up at the
magnificent Lake Ellis after two hours of so.

We bade Lake Ellis goodbye and started our day going down a gentle valley to a stream where we
refilled our water pouches and begin our long gentle ascent along a series of ridges up to Lake
Michaelson's view point.

After stopping for a lunch break and exploring the gorge to lake Michaelson we resumed our hike
through an initial steep ascent then gentler ascents and descents towards the Mintos camp site.
The region is very stony and bare, it gave the impression of an "martian" landscape.


Mintos camp revealed itself to us as a dry pan lake at looked at a flooding plain when it rains. It
was flat with dry cracked soil, pretty much how a dried lake pan looks likes.
We went and explored the nearby "temple" that offered a stunning view of Lake Michaelson from a
high cliff, and a group of lakes that are collectively referred to as Lake Mintos. They were
beautiful with rock walls and panoramic views.
